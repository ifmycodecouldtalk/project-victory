# Project Victory
*the solution to all of your productivity needs. get work done, and track your progress in your company and around the world*

## What Is Project Victory?
Project Victory focuses on one key issue that I think many people face in the world, and that is <u>idleness</u>. The purpose of
this project is to introduce a system to users that allow them to keep track of important tasks (thus prompting them to come up
with tasks that need to be complete) and events (with working notifications systems) as well as earn ranking points to compete
with others around the world with their productivity (what I personally believed to be the missing element). 

## FAQ
> *There are already productivity apps made by large corporations. Why should users choose Victory?*

Let's look at some of the current leading applications for productivity:
    * Todoist: A popular to-do list application. The issue? The users have no incentive to complete the tasks within the app!
                It's a fantastic app, if only the user had a driving force that ensured that they kept opening the app.
    * Trello: Another task management application. With this one, I just feel like the UI can be made simpler, less crowded. With
                Franklin's Schedule Tree model, there is less need for clutter and the user's tasks all fit within one view.
