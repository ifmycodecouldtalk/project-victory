# Project Victory
*the solution to all of your productivity needs. get work done, and track your progress in your company and around the world*

## What Is Project Victory?
Project Victory focuses on one key issue that I think many people face in the world, and that is <u>idleness</u>. The purpose of
this project is to introduce a system to users that allow them to keep track of important tasks (thus prompting them to come up
with tasks that need to be complete) and events (with working notifications systems) as well as earn ranking points to compete
with others around the world with their productivity (what I personally believed to be the missing element).
